# What we could do

## Log Only
- Build Complete MLP on the whole data (how to treat signal data -> get features?)
- Build a MLP that tries to predict between three classes (Normal, Start, End) at each time point (we concat all time points at each step) (Or binary ? inside vs. outside the clot) (GRU)
